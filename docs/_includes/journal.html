                    <p>OPUS now has a journal club! This is a very informal way to start to get comfortable with reading academic papers with your undergraduate peers. Each meeting will be hosted by someone who will talk through some of the key points of the paper and we will all discuss any questions or concerns we might have. Journal club is open to anyone and if you would like to get involved please email us. We will meet every two weeks and the journal we will be reviewing will be posted below. </p>
                    <p>OPUS currently offers $600 bursaries, free first year tutoring, organizes the CAP lectures for the faculty, and more. Membership is free and welcome to any undergraduate student (from any department), however only volunteer tutors are offered study carrels in 206 Allen.</p>
