                    <p>OPUS now has a journal club! This is a very informal way to start to get comfortable with reading academic papers with your undergraduate peers. Each meeting will be hosted by someone who will talk through some of the key points of the paper and we will all discuss any questions or concerns we might have. Journal club is open to anyone and if you would like to get involved please email us. We will meet every two weeks and the journal we will be reviewing will be posted below. </p>

                    <p>Journal Club will be meeting again on zoom on October 14th at 3 pm. 
 
                    This time we will be led by the OPUS Vice President, Cole, presenting a paper on the recent research that resolved a long-standing tension by making a very precise measurement on lepton flavour universality! Click the button below for the paper.</p>

                    <p>Cole will be going through the important aspects of the article, but if you have the chance to read the abstract and conclusion or more and form some questions, it will make our discussion even more interesting.

                    Please email us at opus.uofm@gmail.com for the zoom link
