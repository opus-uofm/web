                    <p>OPUS now has a journal club! This is a very informal way to start to get comfortable with reading academic papers with your undergraduate peers. Each meeting will be hosted by someone who will talk through some of the key points of the paper and we will all discuss any questions or concerns we might have. Journal club is open to anyone and if you would like to get involved please email us. We will meet every two weeks and the journal we will be reviewing will be posted below. </p>

                    <p>Journal Club will be resuming its bi-weekly meetings this Monday, January 25th, at 3 pm. August will be discussing this article:</p>

                    <p>If you have the chance to read it beforehand and form some questions, that will make our discussion even more interesting!
