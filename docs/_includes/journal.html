                    <p>OPUS now has a journal club! This is a very informal way to start to get comfortable reading academic papers with your peers. Each meeting will be hosted by an undergraduate student who will talk through some of the key points of the paper, followed by a group discussion where everybody is encouraged to raise any questions that they may have. Journal club is open to anyone who is interested! If you would like to get involved, please email us at opus.uofm@umanitoba.ca. </p>

                    <p> Meeting time will be announced on our members discord. </p>

                    <p>If you have the chance to read it beforehand and form some questions, that will make our discussion even more interesting!
