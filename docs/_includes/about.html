                    <p>Ever since its founding many years ago, OPUS has been connecting curious and ambitious undergraduate students with a passion for physics. To this day, we are an inclusive and welcoming community of like-minded physicists, keen on problem solving and collaboration. See the “become a member” section below for information on how to get involved – it’s free!</p>
                    <p>OPUS aims to create as many opportunities for undergraduate physics students as possible. Among many other activities, we offer a free help centre and “Exam Cram Sessions” for first-year physics classes, volunteer opportunities and outreach, OPUS get-togethers, a journal club, an annual $750 bursary, and a space on campus in which to study and meet new people!</p>
                    <p>We are currently situated in room 106-110 in the Allen building on the Fort Garry UofM campus. Come stop by and say hello!</p>
