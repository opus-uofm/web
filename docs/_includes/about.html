                    <p>Decades have passed since the founding of OPUS but it has always been an orchestra of curious and ambitious students that share a passion for Physics and Math. To this day, it aims to connect like-minded students, and continues to maintain its amicable position within the department. </p>
                    <p>OPUS currently offers $600 bursaries, free first year tutoring, organizes the CAP lectures for the faculty, and more. Membership is free and welcome to any undergraduate student (from any department), however only volunteer tutors are offered study carrels in 206 Allen.</p>
